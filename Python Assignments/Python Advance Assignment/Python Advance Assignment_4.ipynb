    "Answer:- The __str__ and __repr__ methods implement object print displays. The former is called by the print and str built-in functions; the latter is called by print and str if there is no __str__, and always by the repr built-in, interactive echoes, and nested appearances. That is, __repr__ is used everywhere, except by print and str when a __str__ is defined. A __str__ is usually used for user-friendly displays; __repr__ gives extra details or the object’s as-code form.\n"

    "Answer:- When a class naturally matches, or needs to emulate, a built-in type’s interfaces. For example, collections might imitate sequence or mapping interfaces, and callables might be coded for use with an API that expects a function. You generally shouldn’t implement expression operators if they don’t naturally map to your objects naturally and logically, though—use normally named methods instead."
