    "Answer:- Classes are always nested inside a module. Classes are attributes of a module object. Classes and modules are both namespaces, but classes correspond to statements (not entire files) and support the OOP notions of multiple instances, inheritance, and operator overloading (modules do not). In a sense, a module is like a single instance class, without inheritance, which corresponds to an entire file of code."
